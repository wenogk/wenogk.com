Let me list out the problems I had with it to explain why I needed this redesign. \n\n\n  I paid for shared VPS hosting, which wasn’t the best therefore the website was rather slow to load.\n  Wordpress doesn’t give me enough control of my own website, I found myself installing a thousand plugins to do everything I wanted whereas I could have done it in a couple of minutes if I had complete access to the code rather than having to make a PHP workaround on Wordpress’s already designed system.\n  Too many dependancies, there’s databases for literally everything stored in MySQL, even the wordpress admin password so when I want to backup and restore I need to restore not only all the wordpress files but also all the SQL files.\n  Wordpress is heavy, which I think is another factor that made the website slow to load.\n\n\nI was intrigued by Jekyll when I first read about it.\n\n\n  Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub’s co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license. ~ Wikipedia\n\n\nI also got a free Github pro account because of the Github student program that gives free pro accounts to college students. Github pages is usually for simple static webpages but jekyll just changed the game. For simple blogs, jekyll provides everything you need and gives you full control\n",

I became a part of the iGem team at the beginning of this year. To be fair, it can involve a lot of engineering and computer science depending on the project the team is working on.\n\nThis year we decided to build a device to be used in airports that is non-invasive and can detect 5 diseases using only saliva. No more blood swabs! I was the head of the computer science team. My work first entailed working on the website with the computer science team as it is one of the three things the judges will see (the presentation and the poster being the other two) and developing the WEB API for the device.\n\n\n\nThe Website\n\nWe took inspiration from pages such as the One Plus 7 Pro Phone website with its smooth scrolling animations:\n\nI researched many scroll animation javascript libraries for weeks on end and could not get a library that seemed to work smoothly accross browsers. At the verge of giving up I just decided to inspect element (view source) of the oneplus and apple website and to my surprise they both used the same scroll animation library, scrollmagic.js This was surprising because I thought they’d have implemented the animations from their own animation library or vanilla js. I started working with the scrollmagic library and once I got the hang of it I was amazed at its power. The tween and tweenmax functions allow for precise control of the timing, placement, css styles for the animations and this makes very complex animations possible. After a couple of days hacking around with the library I was able to do parallax scrolling animations just as the oneplus and apple website animations work.\n\nHeres the homepage link: https://2019.igem.org/Team:NYU_Abu_Dhabi (the website is optimized for desktop viewing)\n\nThe github repository can be visited at\n\nThe API\n\nOur device, when used at airports all around the world would spit out a large amount of data.

      title: "How I found a loophole in Facebook's messaging system when I was 14",
      category: null,
      content: "I was watching the news one day and I saw a report on a Palestinian man who found a bug on Facebook that allowed anyone to post on anyone’s Facebook wall but wasn’t taken seriously by Facebook so he posted on Mark Zuckerberg’s (the CEO of Facebook) account to prove himself. When I saw this I started to get interested in Computer Security and the idea of Ethical Hacking. Even though they never revealed how he did it, I was pretty sure I knew how and was intrigued in how simple it was and why I didn’t think of it - this then led me to a nonstop search for loopholes on facebook for the next few days. I was surprised when I actually did find a loophole, and it was a more serious one than the one that was reported on the news. I found a way to send a message as anyone, to anyone - meaning a hacker could send a message to your parent’s facebook as if it was you with anything they wanted to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video above is a demo proof of the loophole in action all the way back in 2013. Let me explain how I did it:\n\nTo understand how the loophole worked you need to understand Facebook’s Email System that was introduced in 2010.\n\n\n  “In February 2010, TechCrunch reported that Facebook was working to rewrite its messaging service to turn it into a “fully featured webmail product”, dubbed “Project Titan”. The feature, unofficially dubbed a “Gmail killer” internally, was launched on November 15, 2010, and allowed users to directly communicate with each other via Facebook using several different methods. Users could create their own “username@facebook.com” email address to communicate, use text messaging, or through the Facebook website or mobile app’s instant messaging chat. All messages were contained within single threads in a unified inbox. The email service was terminated in February 2014 because of low uptake.” ~ Wikipedia\n\n\nSo everyone on facebook had an email called yourusername@facebook.com, as my username on facebook was iwenogk my email was iwenogk@facebook.com. A feature that was really interesting to me in this email system was that you have two emails basically the email you used to sign up to facebook, lets say for me that was wenogk1999@gmail.com and the new facebook email, iwenogk@facebook.com and if I send an email from the email that I signed up with (wenogk1999@gmail.com) to one of my friend’s facebook email’s such as sam@facebook.com - it would go to Sam’s facebook account as a PRIVATE FACEBOOK MESSAGE from my FACEBOOK account and NOT my email and this is the feature that I exploited.\n\nIn the PHP language and basically any server scripting language, theres a mailing system where you can, “spoof” the headers of the email which is the sender, receiver, name, email content information. So I wrote a simple PHP script which spoofs a fake email from my account to my sister’s account with the email message as the message I want to send to my sister and created a small user interface to do this so I could send it to facebook.\n\nI then submitted a Facebook Bug report:\n\n\n  —–Original Message to Facebook—–From: xxxxxxx@gmail.comTo: xxxx Subject: Mobile app bug on iOS and Android .                                               Name: Romeno Wenogk FernandoE-Mail: xxxxxxxx@gmail.comType: privacyScopeDescription: Facebook has been made in order to support the social infrastructure needed to help in connecting people around the world. But, unintentional bugs like the one I found by Remote Code Execution would be a problem in the wrong hands. Please read till the end.The bug I found would allow a hacker to send a message as someone other than himself to another person without even logging in to another person’s account.Take this example, John and Melissa are FRIENDS on facebook. A hacker can send a message as John to Melissa without logging into John’s account - The hacker would just need John’s email and Melissa’s facebook username. I know that Facebook products that integrate with SMTP validate the authenticity of email messages whenever possible (with SPF, DKIM, and/or DMARC). In the absence of these authentication signatures, Facebook will display a visible warning to the user indicating that the sender of the message could not be verified - ONLY ON THE MAIN SITE (FACEBOOK.COM) .The bug works flawlessly on the phone/tablet FACEBOOK APPS on both IOS and Android. I did not use real accounts while testing the bug out, I used the test accounts provided by the Facebook Whitehat Program.This could impact people in many different ways, hackers can abuse the system to either spam people as if they were friends, a hacker can lead a person to a phishing site or a site with malware/viruses. All I’m saying is that this bug is worth fixing and that it WILL be abused if it goes to the wrong hands, I think the best thing to do is to fix this problem as soon as possible. You cannot say this is not a bug since anyone can send a message as anyone and on the mobile app the messages look very authentic and show no signs of fraud - so if you think a hacker sending a message as anyone to someone else is not a wrong thing, then this is not a bug. REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A BUG REPORTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MOBILE FACEBOOK APP - IT IS NOT A BUG FOR THE MAIN SITE. AND THE BUG WORKS FLAWLESSLY.Contact me at xxxxxxxxx@gmail.comProof:In order to prove this to you properly, I have recorded by iPad (which is NOT jailbroken) with iTools and uploaded a video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zibaV-dp0\n\n\nDue to my bad luck I suppose, someone had apparently already emailed them about the same loophole. However, this didn’t bother me as I now had validation that this indeed was a real loophole and someone else thought of the exact same loophole I did.\n\n\n  Hi, We have previously been made aware of this issue and are in the process of investigating it. Thank you for submitting it to us. Please send along any additional security issues you encounter. Jeff Security Facebook\n\n\nI got a bit hot-headed about the short reply to my bug report and inquired further about it and got this reply:\n\n\n  Hi Romeno,I replied to all of your previous reports.The root issue is the same in all of your reports as you have shown you can send spoofed mail and a spoofed message warning may not appear when using the mobile version of the site. The issue was reported to us by another researcher prior to your submission and is still in the process of being resolved. Sometimes a researcher will report a bug and another researcher will discover the same bug and report it to us and while a fix is being developed. This is one of those cases. If you have any other questions or concerns, please let me know and I will try to address them.Thanks,JeffSecurityFacebook\n\n\nWhat shocked me however, is how the loophole was fixed within a day of my report, and my method never worked again. I felt accomplished even though I wasn’t given credit for the loophole, I felt as though I had made a change to Facebook, a billion dollar company, myself, being the mischievous 14 year old boy I was sitting in my bedroom after school with my mini laptop.\n",

      category: null,
      content: "In 2010, when I was 11 years old, My family and I went to watch The Social Network, a movie about how Facebook was founded. I was deeply motivated by this movie and I started looking into the programming language used to code facebook which was PHP at the time. I started looking into simple html, javascript tutorials first and then went on to look at some PHP tutorials - I quickly realized how powerful this tool is as I could make anything I imagined, all that was required was the thought and the code. I started with simple projects such as asking your name and information and giving you interesting facts to a small product search engine system based on keywords and a MYSQL database, which I amusingly tried to sell online in 2012:\n\n\n\nMy dream at the time had always been to make my own social network. I started by learning how to make my own Login and Registering system including the UI, backend and database. From there it was an exponential learning experience where I kept learning and implementing features that a social network would have such as a wall, profile, like button, commenting etc. which brought me to Myslsm. My school’s name is Sri Lankan School Muscat, Slsm for short. I named the social network Myslsm for this reason.\n\n\n\nProfile\nWith a profile you have an identity in myslsm.com, It contains data about you such as Photo, Name, House , Class, Phone number and a small area to write some information about yourself.\n\n\n\nFrontyard\nThe concept is pretty much the same as in our school frontyard; where everyone is aware of the events taking place. Similarly, the Frontyard in myslsm.com is an open place where anyone can post anything. For example, the POG can post ‘Saturday evening basketball practices are cancelled’\n\n\n\nBackyard\nUnlike the frontyard, the backyard is a private wall where only selected people can see your posts, later you will be able to change who can view your posts, thereby personalizing it.\n\n\n\nStaffroom\nThe staffRoom is a place where teachers can share and post but only teachers can see the posts. For example, ‘Teacher Helen, please meet me on Thursday for a short meeting”\n\nLessons\n“Lessons” is a feature where anyone can upload a lesson for others to learn like videos, documents, files or youtube educational videos (This will be closely monitored by me). As for now, I have already uploaded the ‘I AM ONLY A CHILD’ video and ‘The CHAOS’ by Gerard Nolst Trenité. ”\n\n\n\nInterval\nMost of the features of the site are for educational purposes but there’s one feature for your free time, anyone can see educational, music, humor videos to entertain themselves, mostly as part of a study break. I have uploaded some popular songs for the time being.\n\nArticles\nThis can act as an updated information resource for the school like an online magazine.\n\n\n\nTalk2\n\nOne interesting feature that I added onto Myslsm that doesn’t really fit with the other social network features was Talk2. Remember this is in around 2013 where there was no Google Assistant, no Alexa, no machine learning. I made a micro-intelligent bot that could answer questions asked as text input or speech-to-text input (look at image) such as “What is the weather like in _\\_?”, “What is the definition of ___\\_?”, “Tell me about the movie ___\\_”, “Search for images of ___\\_”, “Search for _____” and simple conversational precoded statements like, “hi” and, “how are you” and it would answer in text and voice (using the google translate voice api at the time) at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nI now notice that I realized the power of Google in my talk2 system as the query, “Search for _\\__” would use Google’s then, “I’m feeling lucky” search so basically it would return the first result of the google search for the ___ as the answer. Google is in my opinion the only entity that can find relavant information in the quadrillions of websites in the world from a single keyword, using its pagerank algorithm, which is why I feel the Google Assistant has a great advantage over Alexa.\n\n\n",

I was 13 at the time, I had recently gotten the hang of PHP and built a social network for my school from scratch but this isn’t about that, this is about a hack. \n\nSo I was looking at Sean Parkers Facebook Profile Page and reading some posts on it when I spontaneously decided to send him a friend request just for fun knowing that nothing would come of it. A few hours later I get a notification saying the friend request is accepted. I was ecstatic. I tried sending him messages saying hi but he wouldn’t see them or reply. The excitement then passed for a few days until I posted a funny meme and tagged some of my friends and Sean Parker in the post, because he is technically my friend now.\n\nThousand likes. I got a thousand likes on the post. To a normal 13 year old on social media who usually gets a max of 30 likes, a thousand likes is beyond ones imagination. But I wouldn’t call myself a normal 13 year old, being the devious kid I was, I saw an opportunity. With such a large reach and with the reach being Sean Parker, the president of Facebook’s followers, I could use this to my advantage. I set up a phishing page on my web server, which is basically a clone of the facebook login page, except when a user enters their username and password, I wrote a simple PHP script where their login details are conveniently sent to me. I then posted a link to it on my Facebook saying, “Hey guys check out this new version of Facebook!”, tagging Sean Parker, the president of Facebook. Five seconds after I posted I refreshed the text file that would have the login details. Nothing. Ten seconds. Nothing again. It didn’t work.     I reloaded again. One hundred lines, with login details of Sean Parker’s following. Five seconds later. Another hundred. I was overwhelmed. I closed my mini HP laptop and started wondering why I did this in the first place. I couldn’t understand why then but I do now, I did it simply because I could, not taking a moment to see if it was right or wrong. I opened my laptop again and I see a blip in the messages section on Facebook notifying me that I have a private message. It was Sean Parker.  \n\n\n",

By seriously I mean playing for six hours straight, sweating, aching legs, and raising our voices causing random students who pass by to look at us weird. It’s 2am when I go back to my room, I just fall on my bed and think of the hackathon(which starts at 6am) the next day, ‘No way I’m going to go for that, I’m way too tired’, and I doze off in a flash.\n\nKnock knock. I hear banging on my door, “Get up you have your hackathon!”.  I bolted as soon as my roommate said that and checked my phone for the time, 5:50am. Got up. Brushed my teeth. Washed my face. Ran.\n\nI was lucky it was close as the Hackathon was held my university, New York University Abu Dhabi. “The 2018 7th ANNUAL NYUAD HACKATHON FOR SOCIAL GOOD IN THE ARAB WORLD”, a mouthful that does do justice to the prestige of the Hackathon with students coming from prestigious universities such as MIT, Princeton and mentors from companies like Google.\n\nI entered. I see a group of people standing and listening to one figure in the middle, deep in conversation so I sneaked in to their little circle. Everyone looked at me. I tried to fake a smile back and as I do it, I catch a glance at the ID Card one of the congregates and saw it, Mentors. I now turn my intention from faking a smile to hiding my utter surprise. I slide myself away from the group feeling the peering eyes lasering me. I find another door and was glad to find the hackathon finally.\n\nThe initial set up was honestly very weird. There were sets of tables arranged with labels on them such as, “Education”, “Security &amp; Logisitcs”,”Refugees” etc. I was told to sit at any table I preferred so I just went to the Security one as it seemed fine to me as I am (kind of) interested in the field. I met a few people on my table, one of whom was another student from NYUAD and the rest were from other universities from all around the globe. We had mentors too, with us on our table. Our task was to brainstorm ideas that relate to our table topic, Security &amp; Logistics or at least use it in our ideas. We started blurting out our half thought ideas and came up with ideas from Mental Health apps to Driving Assistants. Suddenly, someone (I can’t remember who) mentioned an idea which was something like this:\n\n\n  An sms system(probably using Twilio) where people could report themselves safe in a natural disaster, just in case their families were worried.\n\n\nThis idea grew on us and we kept improving on it,\n\n\n  What if someone was lost and sends our system an sms with his name, age location, small message, and their family at any time could again sms our system with their loved one’s name and age and  his family will be notified that he is safe and they will be able to get in contact. This would work well for refugees who don’t have their own phone numbers or contact methods.\n\n\n\n\nThat was basically one of our final ideas that we submitted. Yes, we had to submit a set of ideas and get one of it approved by the judges to actually work on it. This rule was annoying but surprisingly worked well for us.\n\nIt was time to get the results of the judges, our sms idea was approved, with a small change. The judge who came to tell us this told it to us in a Steve Jobs, “One More Thing” fashion. He said at the end of saying it was approved, “You guy’s should remove the idea of the lost person sending an sms and use video cameras and facial recognition to detect their faces and match them with a photo that the families provide.”. WOW. We were all gobsmacked. It was a brilliant idea that had our concept in its skeleton but it opened up a whole new aspect to the idea.\n\nThe first thing we did was research on what the possible ways to do it was. It was a 3 day hackathon so we had time to try things. We started with OpenCV for image processing and realized it wouldn’t be effective as it was used for facial recognition of images which meant we’d have to split a video into frames and run OpenCV on ever single frame which was inefficient as OpenCV wasn’t optimized for this. As I did some future research I found Amazon AWS Rekognition (Yes, spelled like that). It used a convolutional neural network and did exactly what we needed it to do, find faces in a video. We knew what we needed to do so we went all in. We divided the work we needed to do, some worked on UI and Design, some on the presentation and some (including me) on the backend and the integration with Amazon AWS.\n\nWe worked really hard with our mentors for two sleepless nights, going home at around 3am to sleep a few hours only to come back and work. The morning of the final day of the hackathon, we had a full working prototype of a system where a family could upload a picture of their loved one and our system would go through thousands of hours of refugee camp videos that were widely available and find where this individual is and inform the family where exactly he/she is.\n\n\n\nWe presented and demoed our project and weren’t too confident about the final outcome. Just a second before the final winner announcement comes up, our mentor looked back in us and said, “Tough luck guys, I don’t think we got this.” and I was flabbergasted. The next second, “And the winner of the7th ANNUAL NYUAD HACKATHON FOR SOCIAL GOOD IN THE ARAB WORLD is Boosala”. “Boosala” means find in arabic, which we felt did justice to our app. One thing that hit me though, after all the excitement of winning, was that if my roommate didn’t wake me up, things would’ve been a little different.\n\nYou can find our code and presentation here: \n\nThe hackathon was featured on many press articles:\n\nEnglish Press\n\n\n  WAMDA\n  Entrepreneur ME magazine – attached\n  Abu Dhabi World magazine (English)&nbsp;– attached\n  Communicate magazine\n  Al Bawaba\n  world.einnews\n  Tahawul tech\n  Al-press\n  Dubai Forum\n  Toner News\n  MyNews.is\n  \nArabic\n\n  Al Ittihad&nbsp;– attached\n  Al Bayan&nbsp;– attached\n  Al Khaleej&nbsp;– attached\n  Al-Ain.com\n  24.ae\n  Zawya\n  Gate.ahram\n  UAE shafaqna\n  Rjeem\n  Free Pen\n  DOT Emirates\n  Lomazoma\n  Bedayya\n  \n\nBroadcast\n\n\n  Abu Dhabi TV – Sabah Al Dar program\n  Abu Dhabi TV – Oloom Al Dar program\n  \n\nSocial media\n\n\n  Wamda – Twitter\n  Abu Dhabi TV – Instagram\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      content: "\nThis is my Intro to Interactive Media - Final Class Project documentation.\n\nBackground\n\nMy final project was a, “DJ Mixer” where the user could use his/her own hands to control and mix two songs together to play at the same time. For example, Ed Sheerans’s shape of you background music could be played with Justin Bieber singing love yourself. \n\n\nTimeline\n\n1) Used the Minim Processing library to simply play 2 songs at the same time, one kareoke and one acapella, and was working on a volume controller which looked like this initially and worked with the cursor on the computer:\n\n\n\n2) Integrated it to the kinect using  a library by Dan Shiffman and added pause buttons.\n\n\n\n3) Added many more songs, removed pause buttons, instead the currently playing song could be hovered on to pause.  \n\n\n\n4) I then made many improvements to the previous version:\n    * I improved the design a bit.\n    * Cropped the mp3 files of the songs to go directly to the music rather than a pause or an intro as many of the youtube videos had them.\n    * Made the webcam visible in a small area at the bottom.\n    * I also made the volume be always visible to the user as it wasn’t clear to them that that functionality was possible.\n\n\n\n5) The final update was mainly a huge UI and Design bump which I will go over in the next section. I also added a, “DJ Training” stage in order to train users on how to move the hand around the screen to select stuff. (In the video below I use the computer cursor as the pointer for demo purposes)\n\n\n\nTechnical Aspect\n\nThe base of my project was not hard to make. I am glad I went with the object oriented approach as I’m sure it saved me TONS of time as I started making many upgrades to it. I created a Song class that included the functionality of instantiating the song with its song file, displaying the song on the screen, having on hover functionality for that song, playing and pausing functions. I then made an array of Song objects in a songs array and instantiated them all. This made it trivial to add new songs. Using an object oriented approach allowed me to implement the volume controller class and add in many design improvements such as font and on hover shading easily.   The controlling of the cursor was perhaps the most important part technically as it is what gives the user the ability to interact with my project so it had to be as seamless as possible which is why I focused on it a lot. The kinect integration was simple as I got the code from Dan Shiffmans website. However, the detection of the hand was VERY buggy initially and I had to make many changes to optimize it specifically for my requirement:\n\n\n  The first important thing I did was make the cursor return to a specific spot if there is no depth greater than the threshold value. This reduced some unintentional clicking.\n  The second is that I optimized Dan Shiffman’s Kinect class to suit my needs by adding 2 counters: one totalArea counter which increments in the for loop and one handArea counter which also increments in the for loop but only when the depth is greater than the threshold value. I then only allowed the movement of the cursor if handArea/totalArea=0.065 as after some testing found that the hand is less than 6.5% of the total kinect screen.\n  \n    I made everything hover based, any song, pause button and volume control has its own counter which I use to make it function only when the cursor hovers over that part for some time. This dramatically reduced unintentional clicks.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nDesign and Interactivity\n\nAs you have seem there was a bump in the design from the 90% ready project and the 100% ready project. Let me take you through some of my decisions.\n\n\n  The adding of icons was important as professor suggested, as it gave the users a clear idea of what would happen when clicked which is why I used icons for pause, and a sound icon near the volume controllers. This worked well in practice as I didn’t have to explain much to the users, they simply knew what to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI added a hover shade effect when a user hovers over a song name and a color change to the pause buttons when hovered. I did this so that first time users would know that the song is indeed clickable (or pause button). It almost gives the, ‘hyperlink’ feel to the user which is familiar to them and hence serves my project better in terms of interaction.\n\n\n  I worked hard on the volume controller, which is why it has its own class. I wanted to design it just like a volume controller in a dj rack where the user could move a knob along a slider in order to control the volume. I did this so the user could relate what they see to a volume knob in a sound mixer in order to know what the volume controller does.  The background of the volume controller initially were horizontal, equally spaced lines but I decided to make it random constantly moving lines to give it a live feel so that the user knows that something can be done by using it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  I needed a good font as the one I selected initially wasn’t appealing to many users. I wanted a font that would be:\n    \n      Easy to read\n      Had some type of old-school tech feel to it (like how text is displayed on a small LED display)\n      Seemed intriguing to catch some passer-by’s attention After some considerable research, I found a font called “underwood”, which seemed like a good choice as it fit my criteria.\n    \n  \n  The background image of a DJ rack that I found on google images was a nice addition as it fit my project well. The two racks seemed cohesive with the two sides (kareoke and acapella) that the user could choose songs from. Many users actually started hovering over the DJ racks themselves thinking it would do something.\n\n",

      content: "\nSo for this project I wanted to do some data visualization that could be regarded, “live”. I got some interesting rates of from http://www.ecology.com/birth-death-rates/ where I found that the rate of birth worldwide is about 4 every second and the rate of death as 1.78 every second.\n\nThe idea was to basically show the user how many people have born and died since they opened the application and perhaps make them understand the importance of life by its fragility and beauty. \n\nI used this data to implement a simple data visualization which you can see in the video above.\n\nI randomly switched from the ‘lifeMode’ to the ‘deathMode’ with a 0.02 probability every 1/60th of a second and played a heart beat sound when it changes to give this visualization a more rushed feel.\n\nI used the simple black and white color scheme to make it simple for the user to understand what is death and being born as it can be commonly derived that white represents life and black represents death.\n\nThe user can switch to and fro from death and life by clicking anywhere. And as some type of easter egg I implemented a system where it recognizes how long you stay in either the life or death by clicking and displays it in a pie chart if you press any key on your keyboard (as you can see towards the end of the youtube video). This basically is a type of personality test which shows the user whether they focus of life or death more.  \n",

      content: "\n[xyz-ihs snippet=”musicCircle”] So for my project this week I wanted to recreate some of the music videos for electronic music on youtube such as this one: \n\n\nI was interested in doing this a few months back and when I searched for tutorials they all had to do with getting some video editing software(Sony Vegas Pro) and putting in some scripts. However, now with my knowledge of processing I felt I could do it from scratch with code only and no video editing software, which is what I attempted. It isn’t as seamless as the one above but the general concept is there and it can be improved.\n\n\n\nI also added some small features such as click to move the circle, added some text on the very right hand side so you can only see it when you move the circle and like the trapNation video has a logo in the circle, I added a logo that can be triggered by clicking the space bar.\n\n\n\nThe Code is written in Java specifically for the processing environment: I created a, ‘circleThing’ class which is the circle in the middle that increases its size depending on the Amplitude (note:not frequency). I got the snow effect code from a website online that had a ‘Particle’ class and the rest of that snow code was procedural code. I enhanced it by making a ‘Snow’ class that created ‘Particle’ objects and was generalized so it was customizable. The speed of the snow fall depended on the Amplitude and when it was low I made it reverse the ‘gravity’ with a negative value.\n\nimport processing.sound.*;\n\nAmplitude amp2;\nAudioIn in2;\nCircleThing mainCircle;\nSnow snowfall;\nfloat ears= 0;\nboolean movable=false;\nPImage bg,nyu;\nboolean logoDisplay=false;\n\nclass CircleThing {\npublic int circleX, circleY,defColor;\nCircleThing(int cX, int cY,int defaultColor) {\ncircleX=cX;\ncircleY=cY;\ndefColor=defaultColor;\n}\n\nvoid draw(int cX, int cY, float soundVal,int scaling,PImage nyuImage,boolean displayImage) {\nif(soundVal&amp;gt;0.025) {\nfill(random(255), random(255), random(255));\n} else {\n//fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));\n\nfill(defColor);\n}\nstrokeWeight(10);\nellipse(cX, cY,(200+ soundVal*scaling), (200+soundVal*scaling));\nimageMode(CENTER);\n//rotate(45);\n\nif(displayImage) {\npushMatrix();\nimageMode(CENTER);\ntranslate(cX,cY);\nrotate(-PI/8);\nimage(nyuImage,0,0);\npopMatrix();\n}\n\nString s = \"Made by Romeno Wenogk Fernando. wenogk@nyu.edu\";\nfill(255);\ntextSize(16);\ntext(s, cX+500, cY, 200, 150);\n}\n}\n\nclass Particle {\n\nfloat x; // adds x position property\n\nfloat y; // adds y position property\n\nfloat xVel; // adds xvel property\n\nfloat yVel; // adds yvel property\n\nfloat partsize; // adds a size property\n\n\n\n//Constructor = function// float says where it is xpos/ypos\n\nParticle(float xpos, float ypos) {\n// assigning the values\n\nx = xpos = random (0,600);\ny = ypos;\nxVel = random (-2, 2); // random,(the length of the random)\n\nyVel = random (0, 5); // controls the speed that the snow falls\n\npartsize = random (5, 10);\n}\n\n}\n\nclass Snow {\nParticle[] particles = new Particle[0];\nint maxParticles =100;\n\nSnow() {\n}\nvoid setMax(int val) {\nmaxParticles=val;\n}\nvoid draw(float ears) {\nparticles = (Particle[]) append(particles, new Particle(300, 0));\nif (particles.length&amp;gt;maxParticles) {\nparticles = (Particle[]) subset(particles, 1);\n}\nfor (int i=0; i&amp;lt;particles.length; i++) {\nparticles[i].partsize *=0.975; //make the snow stay reduce size\n\nparticles[i].x += particles[i].xVel;\nparticles[i].y += particles[i].yVel;\nif(ears&amp;gt;0.03) {\nparticles[i].yVel +=0.2;\n} else if(ears&amp;gt;0.05) {\nparticles[i].yVel +=0.4;\n}\nelse if(ears&amp;gt;0.07) {\nparticles[i].yVel +=0.6;\n} else if(ears&amp;gt;0.09) {\nparticles[i].yVel +=0.8;\n} else {\nparticles[i].yVel-=0.1; //reverse gravity\n\n\n}\nellipse(particles[i].x, particles[i].y, particles[i].partsize, particles[i].partsize);\n}\n}\n}\n\nvoid setup() {\nsize(640, 440);\nbackground(90);\namp2 = new Amplitude(this);\nin2 = new AudioIn(this, 0);\nin2.start();\namp2.input(in2);\nmainCircle= new CircleThing(width/2,height/2,45);\nsnowfall= new Snow();\n//bg = loadImage(\"bg.jpg\");\n\n//bg.resize(width,height);\n\n//nyu=loadImage(\"nyu.png\");\n\n//nyu.resize(int(nyu.width*0.5),int(nyu.height*0.5));\n\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\nbackground(0);\nears=amp2.analyze();\nstroke(255);\nstrokeWeight(1);\nprintln(ears);\nfill(255);\nsnowfall.draw(ears);\nstroke(75);\nif(!movable) {\n\nmainCircle.draw(width/2,height/2,ears,190,nyu,false);\n} else {\nmainCircle.draw(mouseX,mouseY,ears,190,nyu,false);\n}\n\n}\n\nvoid mousePressed() {\nmovable=!movable;\n}\n\nvoid keyPressed() {\nlogoDisplay=!logoDisplay;\n}\n\n",

      category: null,
      content: "BeastBot, the angry youtube commentor bot (version 2)\n\nTrying to win Mr Beast’s 1000 dollars for being one of the earliest 10 commenters on his youtube video that comes out on the 19th December 2019.\n\n*DISCLAIMER* To the best of my knowledge, I am not violating any Youtube Guidelines, please do not replicate unless you know what you’re doing.\n\nRaw first thoughts and research\n\n  Set up an interval loop that runs every second as long as we have not already commented on the latest video. Also set up a txt file with just a boolean to show if we have commented on the latest video or not.\n  Write up a function that returns the latest youtube video from Mr. Beast’s channel and check if the latest video is not the, “Last To Stop Biking Wins $1,000,000 (Part 4)” video with video id wMuYiLby3-s as that was the previous video and we’re looking for the one after this.\n    \n      This API call gives out the latest videos: https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key={your_key_here}&amp;channelId={channel_id_here}&amp;part=snippet,id&amp;order=date&amp;maxResults=20\n    \n  \n  If latest video is the one we want to comment on from the previous function. We call the comment function which takes in parameters videoId and comment.\n    \n      This is the API documentation for adding new top level comments to a youtube video:\nhttps://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/commentThreads/insert\n    \n  \n  The bot will comment three times and then set the boolean to true, therefore breaking the loop\n\n\nHuge updates - Version 2\n\n  A simple web interface was made using bootstrap to visualize beastBot\n  In terms of the Youtube Data API quota, each query on the search API takes 100 points per request out of the total 10,000 maximum per day. This quota usage was not good as it would limit the frequency of requests possible therefore had to alternate to the playlist API where the upload playlist of MrBeast’s channel was queried for the latest video, this had a quota of 3 points per request which is a 97% reduction in quota usage\n  Something noticed when testing on my own channel by adding new videos is that the Youtube Data API is very slow in terms of updating its lists of videos (it took around 5 minutes on average to add a new video) therefore further alternatives were required.\n  The first alternative I found was that youtube has an RSS XML service where they provide channel videos to RSS Readers. For example if you go to https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id={channelIDHere} it would give you a xml list of videos. The cool thing about this method is that it doesn’t require API keys or authorization which is neat. Although accessing it programmatically is only possible through a server (cross browser origin problems) which is why I had to create a node.js express server endpoint to get data from the RSS url. The RSS url was however also not fast enough in terms of getting the latest video as it took around 3 minutes on average after testing.\n  The second alternative was the one I didn’t think I’d have to implement having the API’s but due to their inefficiency I had to build my own web scraper. If first inspected the youtube channel’s, “videos” page and “featured” page and noticed that the latest video comes up there quite quickly and noted down the classes of the links pointing to the youtube videos. I also noticed after testing that sometimes the video would first pop up in the featured page and sometimes on the videos page which meant using both would be a good idea. I built a scraper that opens the youtube channel videos url, get’s the latest url link and title by finding the first .yt-uix-tile-link class and returns it. I did the same for the youtube featured videos url. This brought down the time to around 1 minute on average\n    \n      I used cheerio, which is a “Fast, flexible &amp; lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server” in order to quickly find elements on the pages I am scraping on.\n      I noticed after a couple thousand scraping requests, my ip used to scraped was blocked from making any further requests. I then used the TOR-request library on node.js that allows requests to be made anonymously using the TOR network, this proved to be a bit slower as the requests go through other people’s computers around the world. Towards the time the video waas released I switched computers and got the code running on that instead as it had a fresh ip instead of using the TOR request.\n    \n  \n  To make the beast as powerful as possible I used ALL of the methods above into its workflow. I had a total of 6, “hunt” methods that would ALL be run at each loop:\n    \n      hunt() method is to request the latest video from the Youtube API through the playlistItems API\n      hunt2() method is to request the latest video from the RSS XML url for a channels videos from Youtube\n      hunt3() method is to request the latest video by scraping the youtube channel’s “videos” page from my local computer\n      hunt4() method is to request the latest video by scraping the youtube channel’s “featured” page from my local computer\n      hunt5() method does the same as the hunt3() except its anonymous using the tor-request module. This method is slower than hunt3() however was put in as a preqecaution in case my local computer ip was blocked.\n      hunt6() method does the same as the hunt4() except its anonymous using the tor-request module. This method is slower than hunt4() however was put in as a preqecaution in case my local computer ip was blocked.\n At every loop, all 6 of these methods would be carried out and the first to get the latest video would call the execute() method to call the Youtube comment API and comment on the video.\n    \n    \n      To make the code more organized, all of the 6 hunt() methods return a json object as follows.\n         {\n title: \"title\",\n link: \"videoID\"\n }\n        \n        When an error occurs in any of the hunt methods, the title and link would default to “none” making it easier to ignore when handling the response.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSteps / Pseudocode\n\n  Google data API key, client ID, Current latest video id, channelID, upload playlistID have to be hardcoded in the webConfig.js file (not on the repo as has sensitive info)\n  Authorize BeastBot to comment by logging in with Youtube account.\n  State is set up, with a commented boolean to set if executed succesfully, current latest video id variable and quota usage variable.\n  Hunting loop\n    \n      If boolean commented is true,  break loop\n      hunt()\n        \n          If latest video id returned not equal to current latest video id, call execute(latestVideoID) to comment\n        \n      \n      hunt2()\n        \n          If latest video id returned not equal to current latest video id, call execute(latestVideoID) to comment\n        \n      \n      hunt3()\n        \n          If latest video id returned not equal to current latest video id, call execute(latestVideoID) to comment\n        \n      \n      hunt4()\n        \n          If latest video id returned not equal to current latest video id, call execute(latestVideoID) to comment\n        \n      \n      hunt5()\n        \n          If latest video id returned not equal to current latest video id, call execute(latestVideoID) to comment\n        \n      \n      hunt6()\n        \n          If latest video id returned not equal to current latest video id, call execute(latestVideoID) to comment\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Execute function\n    \n      Youtube data API used to comment on video using videoID passed through argument in function\n      Commented boolean set to true to break loop\n        Set up webConfig.js in the /public directory as follows:\n        const API_KEY = \"*********\" //Google API key\nconst CLIENT_ID = \"*********\" //Google Client ID for youtube data API\nconst SERVER_HOST = \"*********\" //mine was http://localhost:8080\nconst commentText = \"Hey Mr.Beast, I hope I win the $1000.

But, I didn’t have a proximity sensor to detect movements and I didn’t want to use buttons as that seemed counterintuitive. What I did find in our kit though, was a photo resistor. I figured if I could connect it and detect when the light intensity is low(when you wave ur hand over the resistor) I could set up some arbitrary values and make the buzzer make some sounds.\n\nIt was relatively straightforward setting up the breadboard with all the components with the help of the tutorials. I learned that we need a potentiometer for an LCD to adjust the brightness so that it can be made visible in any light environment.\n\nI found a function on the sparkfun website that converts frequencies into keys so I could actually play organ keys on the buzzer which was really cool. I also used code from the sparkfun examples to detect the light intensity from the photo resistor.\n\nhttps://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino—v32/experiment-11-using-a-piezo-buzzer\n\nhttps://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino—v32/experiment-6-reading-a-photoresistor\n\nI initially started with a system where I had to manually check the maximum light intensity and then manually enter it as the, ‘startVal’ variable. Then every decrease by 5 units from the startVal frequency would result in a different note being played in the buzzer. Later I improved the function so it keeps detecting the light intensity and updating a, ‘high’ variable so I knew the max intensity without the need of manually entering it. So now it had auto calibration.\n\nHere’s a video of how it worked displaying the note it’s currently playing on the LCD display (I used my phone to bring it closer and further from the photo resistor to vary the light intensity):\n\n#include &lt;LiquidCrystal.h&gt;\n\nconst int jumpVal=5;\n\n\nconst int sensorPin = 0;\nconst int buzzerPin = 9;\nconst int rs = 12, en = 11, d4 = 5, d5 = 4, d6 = 3, d7 = 2;\nint lightLevel, high = 0, low = 1023;\n\nconst int songLength = 1;\nint starterVal;\n\nchar notes[] = \"c\";//dfda ag cdfdg gf \";\n\nint beats[] = {1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,2};\n\nint tempo = 113;\n\nLiquidCrystal lcd(2,3,4,5,6,7);\n\nvoid setup() {\n\n  lcd.begin(16, 2);\n  pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);\n  pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);\n\n\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n\n   lightLevel = analogRead(sensorPin);\n   manualTune();\n   starterVal=map(high, 0, 1023, 0, 255);\n   lcd.setCursor(0, 0);\n   lcd.print(lightLevel);\n   lcd.setCursor(0, 1);\n\n    int i,j, duration, prox;\n    char noteNames[] = { 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'C' };\n    if(lightLevel&lt;(starterVal-(jumpVal))) {\n  for (j = 0; j &lt; 8; j++)\n  {\n    int num=starterVal-(jumpVal*j);\n    if (lightLevel&lt;num) {\n      notes[0]=noteNames[j-1];\n      lcd.clear();\n      lcd.setCursor(0, 0);\n   lcd.print(lightLevel);\n   lcd.setCursor(0, 1);\n      lcd.print(noteNames[j-1]);\n\n      }\n    }\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; songLength; i++)\n  {\n    duration = beats[i] * tempo;  \n\n    if (notes[i] == ' ')          \n    {\n      delay(duration);            \n    }\n    else                          \n    {\n      tone(buzzerPin, frequency(notes[i]), duration);\n      delay(duration);            \n    }\n    delay(tempo/5);              \n  }\n} else {\n        lcd.clear();\n      lcd.setCursor(0, 0);\n   lcd.print(lightLevel);\n   delay(100);\n        }\n\n}\n\nvoid manualTune()\n{\n if (lightLevel &lt; low)\n  {\n    low = lightLevel;\n  }\n\n\n  if (lightLevel &gt; high)\n  {\n    high = lightLevel;\n  }\n  lightLevel = map(lightLevel, 0, 1023, 0, 255);\n  lightLevel = constrain(lightLevel, 0, 255);\n\n}\n\nint frequency(char note)\n{\n\n  int i;\n  const int numNotes = 8;  \n  char names[] = { 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'C' };\n  int frequencies[] = {262, 294, 330, 349, 392, 440, 494, 523};\n\n\n\n  for (i = 0; i &lt; numNotes; i++)  \n  {\n    if (names[i] == note)        \n    {\n      return(frequencies[i]);    \n    }\n  }\n  return(0);  \n\n}\n\n",
