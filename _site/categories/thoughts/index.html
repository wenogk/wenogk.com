    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I recently was accepted into a software company in Oman, Al Madina Development, which has many government funded projects mainly related to security and identity documents. A few days before I started working, I had a look at their website and just wanted to see what CMS system they used and ended up finding a serious loophole on the site that allowed me to have complete control of the site’s content and edit/delete anything. Here’s a video showing you this:</p>

<p>It was 8pm the day before the Hackathon, my suitemate knocks on my door and challenges me…..for a table tennis match. We play table tennis, <strong>seriously</strong>. By seriously I mean playing for six hours straight, sweating, aching legs, and raising our voices causing random students who pass by to look at us weird. It’s 2am when I go back to my room, I just fall on my bed and think of the hackathon(which starts at 6am) the next day, <em>‘No way I’m going to go for that, I’m way too tired’</em>, and I doze off in a flash.</p>

<p><strong>Knock knock.</strong> I hear banging on my door, “Get up you have your hackathon!”.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>So for my project this week I wanted to do some data visualization that could be regarded, “live”. I got some interesting rates of from http://www.ecology.com/birth-death-rates/ where I found that the rate of birth worldwide is about 4 every second and the rate of death as 1.78 every second. The idea was to basically show the user how many people have born and died since they opened the application and perhaps make them understand the importance of life by its fragility and beauty. I used this data to implement a simple data visualization which you can see in the video below: https://youtu.be/wOcuzDV05fk I randomly switched from the ‘lifeMode’ to the ‘deathMode’ with a 0.02 probability every 1/60th of a second and played a heart beat sound when it changes to give this visualization a more rushed feel. I used the simple black and white color scheme to make it simple for the user to understand what is death and being born as it can be commonly derived that white represents life and black represents death. The user can switch to and fro from death and life by clicking anywhere. And as some type of easter egg I implemented a system where it recognizes how long you stay in either the life or death by clicking and displays it in a pie chart if you press any key on your keyboard (as you can see towards the end of the youtube video). This basically is a type of personality test which shows the user whether they focus of life or death more.  </p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Machine Learning, is currently a hot topic in the world of computer science. Google recently built a software called the, ‘AlphaGo’ that plays Go, a game that originated in China more than 2500 years ago. This software isn’t like any other game software like Chess or Cards that you play against the computer. The first version of AlphaGo analysed hundreds of thousands of previously played games and formed algorithms and patterns it could use against its opponents. In March 2016, Google invited the 18-time world champion Lee Sedol to play AlphaGo in Seoul. AlphaGo and Sedol played a total of five games in which AlphaGo won four out of the five</p>

<p>. This earned AlphaGo a 9 dan professional ranking in Go (the highest certification) - the first time a computer Go player had ever received the accolade. This could be considered a great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, until October 2017. The AlphaGo team released a new version of the AlphaGo with a radical concept. This piece of software starts knowing only the basic principles of the game, and plays with itself millions of times and learns from its mistakes, improving itself. AlphaGo Zero had learned all the winning patterns and strategies that were discovered after thousands of years, in a span of three days, and had gone even further to find its own strategies that were even better than the ones currently available. This is further elaborated on the AlphaGo website, “Previous versions of AlphaGo initially trained on thousands of human amateur and professional games to learn how to play Go. AlphaGo Zero skips this step and learns to play simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play. In doing so, it quickly surpassed human level of play and defeated the previously published champion-defeating version of AlphaGo by 100 games to 0.” How does this relate to Jazz? What if we could build a system that dispenses unlimited fresh rich jazz without the need of any instruments or a player present, just a speaker connected to a computer. This could be the future of Jazz, perhaps a hybrid of a human player and a computer playing. As an audience would most definitely enjoy watching a human play physically rather than a computer play electronically. This has been attempted and there are advances in this technology but the results are not nearly as close to real jazz that you and I can enjoy. Jazz is a unique genre and is extremely complicated, so how exactly would we go about the seemingly impossible task of replicating it? To produce rich jazz automatically it is necessary to get into the minds of Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong or John Coltrane and know how they think, what they do, and why they do what they do. This necessity is made possible by machine learning and neural networks. These technologies are based on how we as humans think. Neural networks is defined in the <em>explainthatstuff.com</em> website as, “The basic idea behind a neural network is to simulate (copy in a simplified but reasonably faithful way) lots of densely interconnected brain cells inside a computer so you can get it to learn things, recognize patterns, and make decisions in a humanlike way.” This is exactly what we need in order to produce jazz automatically. The first step would be isolating and correctly identifying each instrument.  To do this we could use the power of neural networks: a simple feedback system would help make an efficient instrument identifier. The common neural network design is called a feedforward network. It consists of three parts: input units, hidden units and output units. We would begin by simply inserting simple audios of each instrument into the system, which we would call the, “input units”. The hidden units would consist of the various types of each instrument grouped and identified by the pitch, amplitude and tone of similar sounding instruments that are saved in the database. The system doesn’t necessarily have to know what each type of instrument is, it just needs to be able to distinguish one from another. The, “hidden units” work by constantly sending information back and forth within the hidden unit section until a threshold is passed, then it is saved in the final database as in the output unit. The threshold is reached with human feedback into the system to correct it when it makes a mistake in identifying an instrument type. I’ve made a simplified diagram to illustrate the neural network to identify an instrument. To advance,we would have to identify the different instruments used and the individual notes played by each instrument in a complete music piece, which would be based on this neural network itself. <a href="http://wenogk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Neural-Network-for-identifying-instruments.png"></a></p>

<p> Once we have the instrument and notes identifier, we would have to start using machine learning algorithms to identify certain patterns and rhythms in each piece of music. If we have a collection of thousands of jazz pieces, both amateur and professional, we could use the patterns and rhythms learned from it to create new rhythms and maybe, “steal” and mix some cohesive tracks together to create something new altogether. This would be a very complex algorithm and would need a lot of time and effort before it is deemed efficient. Using these identified patterns new beats and rhythms can be created as the system will now know the general, ‘structure’ of jazz and hence will be able to improvise. This is all easy to say but very tedious and arduous to do. There has been a successful attempt to produce jazz music automatically but it doesn’t produce the rich, improvised jazzy music that we all know of.</p>

<p>Ji-Sung Kim, a Computer Science student from Princeton University made a software called, “DeepJazz”. DeepJazz uses Keras and Theano, two deep learning software libraries that allow him to make robust algorithms in order to produce his music. His work has been mentioned in many famous publications such as the Guardian and he became the most popular, “AI” artist on SoundCloud as mentioned in the DeepJazz website. Despite all this attention, when one listens to the music that DeepJazz has produced, it seems clunky and not very jazzy.         The music does have a rhythm but the problem is that the software works by taking only one sample song and using that to create its own rhythms and beats. It also produces only piano melodies and not any other instrument which I think limits the capabilities of this software. To actually create a robust automatic jazz music, it needs to be able to produce a music from a range of instruments and have a deep knowledge of jazz like John Coltrane, for example, knew.</p>

<p>Producing Jazz electronically will clearly be a controversial addition to the Jazz culture as I would assume most people would prefer listening to live jazz performed by people themselves. Listening to automatically produced jazz music live would almost be like listening to music at home with an iPod. One could also argue that Jazz is all about expressing emotion and it reflects history, specifically the tragic history of African Americans and since the machine does not have any emotion it will not produce good music. However, because the software would have a deep understanding of thousands of jazz music composed from jazz itself was born, it would have the understanding of jazz music that is better than any human and hence would produce authentic rich jazz music. For live performances, automatically produced jazz can be used to compliment a human jazz players music with some live listening and improvisation by the computer.</p>

<p>Indeed, making the world’s first Unlimited Nonstop Fresh Jazz Making Machine is possible but isn’t going to be here any time soon. Its projects like AlphaGo that make these ideas even plausible. Applying the idea of AlphaGo Zero into the system would mean teaching the very principles of jazz almost as If you were teaching a student who doesn’t necessarily know or have any experience of jazz. The first lesson to our new student, the machine, we would teach it the skill of identifying the instrument, the tempo and the rhythm. We would also encourage our, ‘student’ to listen to as much jazz music as possible, identifying rhythms, instruments, trading techniques and structure and logging them somewhere. We would then encourage the student to play his/her own music by trial and error and their assumption of randomness. With practice and feedback we could create a jazz player who could possibly one day be playing at the next live jazz gig you stumble into.</p>
