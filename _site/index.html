<p>iGem, The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition is a worldwide synthetic biology competition. <strong>Yes, biology.</strong> I love delving into fields I know nothing about. I became a part of the iGem team at the beginning of this year. To be fair, it can involve a lot of engineering and computer science depending on the project the team is working on.</p>

<p>This year we decided to build a device to be used in airports that is non-invasive and can detect 5 diseases using only saliva. No more blood swabs! I was the head of the computer science team. My work first entailed working on the website with the computer science team as it is one of the three things the judges will see (the presentation and the poster being the other two) and developing the WEB API for the device.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I was watching the news one day and I saw a report on a Palestinian man who found a bug on Facebook that allowed anyone to post on anyone’s Facebook wall but wasn’t taken seriously by Facebook so he posted on Mark Zuckerberg’s (the CEO of Facebook) account to prove himself. When I saw this I started to get interested in Computer Security and the idea of Ethical Hacking. Even though they never revealed how he did it, I was pretty sure I knew how and was intrigued in how simple it was and why I didn’t think of it - this then led me to a nonstop search for loopholes on facebook for the next few days. I was surprised when I actually did find a loophole, and it was a more serious one than the one that was reported on the news. I found a way to send a message as anyone, to anyone - meaning a hacker could send a message to your parent’s facebook as if it was you with anything they wanted to.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In 2010, when I was 11 years old, My family and I went to watch The Social Network, a movie about how Facebook was founded. I was deeply motivated by this movie and I started looking into the programming language used to code facebook which was PHP at the time. I started looking into simple html, javascript tutorials first and then went on to look at some PHP tutorials - I quickly realized how powerful this tool is as I could make anything I imagined, all that was required was the thought and the code. I started with simple projects such as asking your name and information and giving you interesting facts to a small product search engine system based on keywords and a MYSQL database, which I amusingly tried to sell online in 2012:</p>

<p>My dream at the time had always been to make my own social network. I started by learning how to make my own Login and Registering system including the UI, backend and database. From there it was an exponential learning experience where I kept learning and implementing features that a social network would have such as a wall, profile, like button, commenting etc. which brought me to Myslsm. My school’s name is Sri Lankan School Muscat, Slsm for short. I named the social network Myslsm for this reason.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>When I was young I was devious, malicious and didn’t know the difference between right and wrong. I was 13 at the time, I had recently gotten the hang of PHP and built a social network for my school from scratch but this isn’t about that, this is about a <strong>hack</strong>.  So I was looking at Sean Parkers Facebook Profile Page and reading some posts on it when I spontaneously decided to send him a friend request just for fun knowing that nothing would come of it. A few hours later I get a notification saying the friend request is accepted. I was ecstatic. I tried sending him messages saying hi but he wouldn’t see them or reply. The excitement then passed for a few days until I posted a funny meme and tagged some of my friends and Sean Parker in the post, because he is technically my friend now. Thousand likes. I got a thousand likes on the post. To a normal 13 year old on social media who usually gets a max of 30 likes, a thousand likes is beyond ones imagination. But I wouldn’t call myself a normal 13 year old, being the devious kid I was, I saw an opportunity. With such a large reach and with the reach being Sean Parker, the president of Facebook’s followers, I could use this to my advantage. I set up a phishing page on my web server, which is basically a clone of the facebook login page, except when a user enters their username and password, I wrote a simple PHP script where their login details are conveniently sent to me. I then posted a link to it on my Facebook saying, “Hey guys check out this new version of Facebook!”, tagging Sean Parker, the president of Facebook. Five seconds after I posted I refreshed the text file that would have the login details. Nothing. Ten seconds. Nothing again. It didn’t work.     I reloaded again. One hundred lines, with login details of Sean Parker’s following. Five seconds later. Another hundred. I was overwhelmed. I closed my mini HP laptop and started wondering why I did this in the first place. I couldn’t understand why then but I do now, I did it simply because I could, not taking a moment to see if it was right or wrong. I opened my laptop again and I see a blip in the messages section on Facebook notifying me that I have a private message. It was Sean Parker.  </p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>So I decided I want to make a bicycle, but I didn’t know how a bike worked and what exactly each component looked like. Cardboard was the material I chose to use because of its availability as it can be easily found in scraps so I’d be able to do many retries with the laser cutter (Continued)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  My first step was to research on bicycles:

  
  
  

  Turns out, figuring out the different parts and components of a bicycle was harder than I thought. I started by drawing some sketches:

  
  
  

  

  
  
  

  I started working on designing the parts on Adobe Illustrator, specifically the cogs that connect the wheels of the bicycle to the pedal cog. I, 'tested' them by putting them close to each other in the drawing and rotating one cog using the rotation tool to see how it would work.

  
  
  


  
  
  

  I then improved the design of the wheels to make it actually look like a bicycle would.

  
  
  

  

  
  
  

  The next step was to laser cut! I had to undergo a training session to learn about safety measures such as cleaning the lenses and also how to optimize the illustrator settings for the best laser cut.

  
  
  


  
  
  

  

  
  
  

  Putting it all together with some watch screws and tape and we get:

        <p>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-iwOhMG2k I took my previous project where I visualized music through the microphone and reversed it. I wanted to in some form visualize the music with my hands and play it on the computer.  I had to make some big changes to the code as I hadn’t generalized the classes enough in my previous project which is something I have to make sure I do next time. I used a library called Minim as the processing sound library didn’t allow pausing which was a vital feature in my project. I selected Fur Elise from Beethoven and the Wonder Woman soundtrack for the two songs because they are so drastic in genre, tone and the way it sounds that it almost feels like a remix mashup in a way.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I recently was accepted into a software company in Oman, Al Madina Development, which has many government funded projects mainly related to security and identity documents. A few days before I started working, I had a look at their website and just wanted to see what CMS system they used and ended up finding a serious loophole on the site that allowed me to have complete control of the site’s content and edit/delete anything. Here’s a video showing you this: https://youtu.be/sUfab2-7XeA I told them of the bug and they were surprised and an engineer fixed it and they gave the credit to me. Throughout the rest of the internship, I had to learn many technologies to able to start working on projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned C#</li>
  <li>Got the hang of Asp, Asp.net</li>
  <li>Brushed up my SQL skills by learning more about complicated JOIN queries</li>
  <li>Started working with git commands</li>
  <li>Learned about the MVC (Model View Controller) Structure and a bit of ASP.NET CORE MVC. I put up some of the sample code I wrote to get the hang of stuff, on my github: </li>
</ul>

<p>https://github.com/wenogk/Almadina_Internship I couldn’t add the code I wrote for the company as they told me it wouldn’t be a good idea to do so.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It was 8pm the day before the Hackathon, my suitemate knocks on my door and challenges me…..for a table tennis match. We play table tennis, <strong>seriously</strong>. By seriously I mean playing for six hours straight, sweating, aching legs, and raising our voices causing random students who pass by to look at us weird. It’s 2am when I go back to my room, I just fall on my bed and think of the hackathon(which starts at 6am) the next day, </p>

<p><em>‘No way I’m going to go for that, I’m way too tired’, _and I doze off in a flash. <strong>Knock knock.</strong> I hear banging on my door, “Get up you have your hackathon!”. I bolted as soon as my roommate said that and checked my phone for the time, _5:50am. _Got up. Brushed my teeth. Washed my face. Ran. I was lucky it was close as the Hackathon was held my university, New York University Abu Dhabi. “_The 2018 7th ANNUAL NYUAD HACKATHON FOR SOCIAL GOOD IN THE ARAB WORLD</em>”, a mouthful that does do justice to the prestige of the Hackathon with students coming from prestigious universities such as MIT, Princeton and mentors from companies like Google. I entered. I see a group of people standing and listening to one figure in the middle, deep in conversation so I sneaked in to their little circle. Everyone looked at me. I tried to fake a smile back and as I do it, I catch a glance at the ID Card one of the congregates and saw it, <em>Mentors. _I now turn my intention from faking a smile to hiding my utter surprise. I slide myself away from the group feeling the peering eyes lasering me. I find another door and was glad to find the hackathon finally. The initial set up was honestly very weird. There were sets of tables arranged with labels on them such as, “Education”, “Security &amp; Logisitcs”,”Refugees” etc. I was told to sit at any table I preferred so I just went to the Security one as it seemed fine to me as I am (kind of) interested in the field. I met a few people on my table, one of whom was another student from NYUAD and the rest were from other universities from all around the globe. We had mentors too, with us on our table. Our task was to brainstorm ideas that relate to our table topic, Security &amp; Logistics or at least use it in our ideas. We started blurting out our half thought ideas and came up with ideas from Mental Health apps to Driving Assistants. Suddenly, someone (I can’t remember who) mentioned an idea which was something like this: _An sms system(probably using Twilio) where people could report themselves safe in a natural disaster, just in case their families were worried.</em> This idea grew on us and we kept improving on it, <em>What if someone was lost and sends our system an sms with his name, age location, small message, and their family at any time could again sms our system with their loved one’s name and age and  his family will be notified that he is safe and they will be able to get in contact. This would work well for refugees who don’t have their own phone numbers or contact methods.</em> That was basically one of our final ideas that we submitted. Yes, we had to submit a set of ideas and get one of it approved by the judges to actually work on it. This rule was annoying but surprisingly worked well for us. It was time to get the results of the judges, our sms idea was approved, with a <strong>small</strong> change. The judge who came to tell us this told it to us in a Steve Jobs, <em>“One More Thing” _fashion. He said at the end of saying it was approved, “You guy’s should remove the idea of the lost person sending an sms and use video cameras and facial recognition to detect their faces and match them with a photo that the families provide.”. WOW. We were all gobsmacked. It was a brilliant idea that had our concept in its skeleton but it opened up a whole new aspect the the idea. The first thing we did was research on what the possible ways to do it was. It was a 3 day hackathon so we had time to try things. We started with OpenCV for image processing and realized it wouldn’t be effective as it was used for facial recognnitionn of images which meant we’d have to split a video into frames and run OpenCV on ever single frame which was inefficient as OpenCV wasn’t optimized for this. As I did some future research I found Amazon AWS Rekognition (Yes, spelled like that). It used a convolutional neural network and did exactly what we needed it to do, find faces in a video. We knew what we needed to do so we went all in. We divided the work we needed to do, some worked on UI and Design, some on the presentation and some (including me) on the backend and the integration with Amazon AWS. We worked really hard with our mentors for two sleepless nights, going home at around 3am to sleep a few hours only to come back and work. The morning of the final day of the hackathon, we had a full working _prototype of a</em> system <em>where a family could upload a picture of their loved one and our system would go through thousands of hours of refugee camp videos that were widely available and find where this individual is and inform the family where exactly he/she is.</em> We presented and demoed our project and weren’t too confident about the final outcome. Just a second before the final winner announcement comes up, our mentor looked back in us and said, “Tough luck guys, I don’t think we got this.” and I was flabbergasted. The next second, “And the winner of the_7th ANNUAL NYUAD HACKATHON FOR SOCIAL GOOD IN THE ARAB WORLD is Boosala”. “Boosala” _means find in arabic, which we felt did justice to our app. One thing that hit me though, after all the excitement of winning, was that if my roommate didn’t wake me up, things would’ve been a little different. You can find our code and presentation here:  The hackathon was featured on many press articles: <strong>English Press</strong></p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This is my Intro to Interactive Media - Final Class Project documentation.</em> <strong>Background</strong> My final project was a, “DJ Mixer” where the user could use his/her own hands to control and mix two songs together to play at the same time. For example, Ed Sheerans’s shape of you background music could be played with Justin Bieber singing love yourself.   </p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Used the Minim Processing library to simply play 2 songs at the same time, one kareoke and one acapella, and was working on a volume controller which looked like this initially and worked with the cursor on the computer: 2. Integrated it to the kinect using  a library by Dan Shiffman and added pause buttons. 3. Added many more songs, removed pause buttons, instead the currently playing song could be hovered on to pause.   4. I then made many improvements to the previous version:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>I improved the design a bit.</li>
  <li>Cropped the mp3 files of the songs to go directly to the music rather than a pause or an intro as many of the youtube videos had them.</li>
  <li>Made the webcam visible in a small area at the bottom.</li>
  <li>I also made the volume be always visible to the user as it wasn’t clear to them that that functionality was possible. 5. The final update was mainly a huge UI and Design bump which I will go over in the next section. I also added a, “DJ Training” stage in order to train users on how to move the hand around the screen to select stuff. (In the video below I use the computer cursor as the pointer for demo purposes)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technical Aspect</strong> The base of my project was not hard to make. I am glad I went with the object oriented approach as I’m sure it saved me TONS of time as I started making many upgrades to it. I created a Song class that included the functionality of instantiating the song with its song file, displaying the song on the screen, having on hover functionality for that song, playing and pausing functions. I then made an array of Song objects in a songs array and instantiated them all. This made it trivial to add new songs. Using an object oriented approach allowed me to implement the volume controller class and add in many design improvements such as font and on hover shading easily.   The controlling of the cursor was perhaps the most important part technically as it is what gives the user the ability to interact with my project so it had to be as seamless as possible which is why I focused on it a lot. The kinect integration was simple as I got the code from Dan Shiffmans website. However, the detection of the hand was VERY buggy initially and I had to make many changes to optimize it specifically for my requirement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first important thing I did was make the cursor return to a specific spot if there is no depth greater than the threshold value. This reduced some unintentional clicking.</li>
  <li>The second is that I optimized Dan Shiffman’s Kinect class to suit my needs by adding 2 counters: one totalArea counter which increments in the for loop and one handArea counter which also increments in the for loop but only when the depth is greater than the threshold value. I then only allowed the movement of the cursor if handArea/totalArea=0.065 as after some testing found that the hand is less than 6.5% of the total kinect screen.</li>
  <li>I made everything hover based, any song, pause button and volume control has its own counter which I use to make it function only when the cursor hovers over that part for some time. This dramatically reduced unintentional clicks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design and Interactivity</strong> As you have seem there was a bump in the design from the 90% ready project and the 100% ready project. Let me take you through some of my decisions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The adding of icons was important as professor suggested, as it gave the users a clear idea of what would happen when clicked which is why I used icons for pause, and a sound icon near the volume controllers. This worked well in practice as I didn’t have to explain much to the users, they simply knew what to do.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://wenogk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-05-08-at-10.31.38-PM-240x300.png"></a></p>

<p>        I added a hover shade effect when a user hovers over a song name and a color change to the pause buttons when hovered. I did this so that first time users would know that the song is indeed clickable (or pause button). It almost gives the, ‘hyperlink’ feel to the user which is familiar to them and hence serves my project better in terms of interaction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I worked hard on the volume controller, which is why it has its own class. I wanted to design it just like a volume controller in a dj rack where the user could move a knob along a slider in order to control the volume. I did this so the user could relate what they see to a volume knob in a sound mixer in order to know what the volume controller does.  The background of the volume controller initially were horizontal, equally spaced lines but I decided to make it random constantly moving lines to give it a live feel so that the user knows that something can be done by using it</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://wenogk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/8163621bd2d1e26fa3c6b99f07d0de907f88fa3e-768x576.jpg"></a><a href="http://wenogk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gif-83x300.gif">      </a></p>

<ul>
  <li>I needed a good font as the one I selected initially wasn’t appealing to many users. I wanted a font that would be:
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to read</li>
      <li>Had some type of old-school tech feel to it (like how text is displayed on a small LED display)</li>
      <li>Seemed intriguing to catch some passer-by’s attention After some considerable research, I found a font called “underwood”, which seemed like a good choice as it fit my criteria.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The background image of a DJ rack that I found on google images was a nice addition as it fit my project well. The two racks seemed cohesive with the two sides (kareoke and acapella) that the user could choose songs from. Many users actually started hovering over the DJ racks themselves thinking it would do something.</li>
</ul>
