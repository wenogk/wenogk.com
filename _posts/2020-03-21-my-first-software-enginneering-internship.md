I recently was accepted into a software company in Oman, Al Madina Development, which has many government funded projects mainly related to security and identity documents. A few days before I started working, I had a look at their website and just wanted to see what CMS system they used and ended up finding a serious loophole on the site that allowed me to have complete control of the site's content and edit/delete anything. Here's a video showing you this: https://youtu.be/sUfab2-7XeA I told them of the bug and they were surprised and an engineer fixed it and they gave the credit to me. Throughout the rest of the internship, I had to learn many technologies to able to start working on projects: 

  * Learned C#
  * Got the hang of Asp, Asp.net
  * Brushed up my SQL skills by learning more about complicated JOIN queries
  * Started working with git commands
  * Learned about the MVC (Model View Controller) Structure and a bit of ASP.NET CORE MVC. I put up some of the sample code I wrote to get the hang of stuff, on my github:
