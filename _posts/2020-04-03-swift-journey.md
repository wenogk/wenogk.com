I have made the decision to learn Native IOS development using the Swift programming language and produce a portfolio of apps. This page would therefore be updated with everything I learn daily. I am primarily doing this to keep myself accountable to my progress.   <!--more-->

## Day 1 
_3rd April 2020_
  * Learned that Swift is a type-safe programming language like Javascript.
  * Multiline strings would be coded like this
{% highlight swift %}
var str1 = """
This goes
over multiple
lines
"""
{% endhighlight %}
  * String interpolation works like this :
{% highlight swift %}
var score = 85
var str = "Your score was \(score)"
{% endhighlight %}
